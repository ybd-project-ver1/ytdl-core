* **YtdlCore:** Static methods such as the `getFullInfo` function have been eliminated in view of optional adaptations, etc.
* **Stream:** Added option `streamType` to specify the type of stream to receive (ReadableStream or Readable (for Node.js)) in `download` functions, etc. (The type specification of the stream is done as follows)
```ts
import { YtdlCore, YTDL_NodejsStreamType } from '@ybd-project/ytdl-core';

const ytdl = new YtdlCore({
    streamType: 'nodejs',
});

ytdl.download<YTDL_NodejsStreamType>('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID', { filter: 'audioandvideo' }).then((stream) => {
    // If the default (ReadableStream), it cannot be piped.
    stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(process.cwd() + '/results/video.mp4'));
});

// If not Node.js, import `YTDL_DefaultStreamType`.
import { YtdlCore, YTDL_DefaultStreamType } from '@ybd-project/ytdl-core';

const ytdl = new YtdlCore({
    streamType: 'default',
});

ytdl.download<YTDL_DefaultStreamType>('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID', { filter: 'audioandvideo' }).then((stream) => {
    ...
});
```

### Change
* **Lang:** Remove the `lang` option and add the `hl` option.
* **Country:** Add `gl` option.
* **Debug:** Eliminated the use of the `YTDL_DEBUG` environment variable. (For debug log display, use the `logDisplay` option instead.)
* **Log:** Added `logDisplay` option to specify the type of log to display.
* **Options:** The `requestOptions` option is obsolete.
* **Request:** Eliminate the use of the internal Undici package.
* **Fetcher:** Add `fetcher` option to control requests. (Allows proxy adaptation, etc. (returns a Response object))
* **Agent:** Proxy adaptation to requests by YtdlCore has been discontinued due to specification issues.
* **PoToken:** Stop using `youtube-po-token-generator` to generate PoToken, and use [`LuanRT/BgUtils`](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) instead, because it cannot generate PoToken correctly. (Experimental, not available in the browser and serverless versions)
* **Player:** To improve the stability of obtaining player IDs, the following two things were implemented.
    1. If it could not be retrieved, ytdl-core retrieve the latest player ID from GitHub ([api.github.com/repos/ybd-project/ytdl-core/contents/data/player/data.json?ref=dev](https://api.github.com/repos/ybd-project/ytdl-core/contents/data/player/data.json?ref=dev)) to get the latest player ID. **(This JSON is updated every day.)**
    2. If the player ID could not be obtained from GitHub, the latest player ID at that time obtained at build time is used.
* **VideoDetails:** Added `playabilityStatus` to video details. The value `OK` takes precedence.
* **Cache:** Added `disableBasicCache` option to disable basic cache.
* **Version:** Added `disableVersionCheck` option to disable version check (In `@ybd-project/ytdl-core`, the Node.js version and browser version are checked).
